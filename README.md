# DataVisualisation_Opdracht1

Explanatory - Static

The poster shows
  - the % of diabetes,
  - the % of people younger than 20 years who have diabetes type 1,
  - the % of hyperglycemia during pregnancy,
  - the % of people with undiagnosed diabetes,
  - the % of mortality younger than 60 years and
  - the % of budget they spend on diabetes per area.
  
I choosed this subject because I'm also a diabetes patient and I always wanted to know how many people have the same disease.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht2

Explanatory - Physical - 3D

I took 2 planks. I glue the boards together and I screws the boards together. On the left side, I wrote absolute values and on the right side, the %. I draw all the rectangles in Fusion 360 and I printed them. Then, I wrote the different provinces and ASO, BSO, KSO and TSO. At the end I have glued all the rectangles on the right place.
