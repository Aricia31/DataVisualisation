Explanatory - Static

The poster shows the percentage of diabetes, the percentage of people younger than 20 years, the percentage of hyperglycemia during pregnancy, the percentage of people with undiagnosed diabetes, the percentage of mortality younger than 60 years and the percentage of money they spend on diabetes per area.
I choosed this subject because I'm also a diabetes patient and I always wanted to know how many people have the same disease.
