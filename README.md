# DataVisualisation_Opdracht1

Explanatory - Static

The poster shows
  - the % of diabetes,
  - the % of people younger than 20 years who have diabetes type 1,
  - the % of hyperglycemia during pregnancy,
  - the % of people with undiagnosed diabetes,
  - the % of mortality younger than 60 years and
  - the % of budget they spend on diabetes per area.
  
I've chosen this subject because I'm also a diabetes patient and I always wanted to know how many people have the same disease.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht2

Explanatory - Physical - 3D

I took 2 planks. I glued the boards together and I screwed the boards together. On the left side, I wrote absolute values and on the right side, the %. I drew all the rectangles in Fusion 360 and I printed them. Then, I wrote the different provinces and ASO, BSO, KSO and TSO. At the end, I glued all the rectangles on the right place.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht3

Exploratory - Interactive - D3

First, I calculated the total number of people who embarked on a plane per year. Then, I calculated how many passengers and how many crew members embarked. At the end, I calculated the %. I did the same thing for the crashed planes.
I began to draw the x and y-axis of the aboard graphic. I added the date and the %. At the end, I drew the circles who represents the number of passengers and crew members that embarked. To distinguish the passengers from the crew members, I gave them another color. I did the same thing for the other graphic. I put the two graphics next to each other. When you hover on a passengers circle, you can see on the other graphic how any died. The same for the crew members.

I've chosen this subject because it's really impressive when you compare both graphics.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht4

Explanatory - Node Based(NodeBox) - Linear

I began to search which metro station has Villo bikestands and how many bikestands they have. I began to draw circles, who represent the number of Villo bikestands per station. Then, I drew the metro stations all around, in a circle shape. I wanted my design to look like a bike. So, I positioned the metro stations inside the circle shape, the circles all around the metro stations and I wrote the quantity of Villo bikestands all around the circles. The result is a bicycle wheel, but it didn't look like a bicycle yet. So, I drew a saddle, a handlebar and a second wheel.

I made a list of 28 people. I've searched one by one the meaning and the origins of their names. I linked the name with his corresponding origin and significance.
