Explanatory - static

The poster shows the evolution of the percentage of diabetes in the world, in 2017 and 2045.
I choosed this subject because I'm also a diabetes patient and I always wanted to know how many people have the same disease.
So, I calculated the percentage per area in 2017 and I did the same for 2045.
I choosed a Pie Chart to illustrate my data, because it gives a clear view of the different parts.
