# DataVisualisation_Opdracht1

Explanatory - Static

The poster shows
  - the % of diabetes,
  - the % of people younger than 20 years who have diabetes type 1,
  - the % of hyperglycemia during pregnancy,
  - the % of people with undiagnosed diabetes,
  - the % of mortality younger than 60 years and
  - the % of budget they spend on diabetes per area.
  
I've choosed this subject because I'm also a diabetes patient and I always wanted to know how many people have the same disease.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht2

Explanatory - Physical - 3D

I took 2 planks. I glue the boards together and I screws the boards together. On the left side, I wrote absolute values and on the right side, the %. I drew all the rectangles in Fusion 360 and I printed them. Then, I wrote the different provinces and ASO, BSO, KSO and TSO. At the end, I have glued all the rectangles on the right place.

# DataVisualisation_Opdracht3

Exploratory - Interactive - D3

First, I calculated the total number of people who climbed aboard on a plane per year. Then, I calculated how many passengers and how many crew members climbed aboard. At the end, I calculated the %. I did the same thing for the crash planes.
I began to draw the x and y-axis of the aboard graphic. I added the date and the %. At the end, I drew the circles who represents the number of passengers and crew members that climbed aboard. To distinguish the passengers from the crew members, I gave them another color. I did the same thing for the crash graphic. I put the two graphics next to each other. When you hover on a passengers circle, you can see on the other graphic how any died. The same for the crew members.

I've choosed this subject because it's really impressive how many people didn't survive.
